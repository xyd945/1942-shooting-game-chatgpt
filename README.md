# 1942-shooting-game-chatgpt
I build this using ChatGPT and Openprocessing without writing a single line of code.



Sorry that ChatGPT doesn't really like to write comment for its code, but guess what you can do? just paste the code to your ChatGPT and ask it to explain it to you. 


my entire conversation with ChatGPT can be found here, including all the debugging discussion I had with it.https://gptsave.xyz/images?id=023af36d-c552-4629-b973-b20a72e76167


Steps to replicate this "devlopment"

1️⃣ Give ChatGPT some description of how you want to build the game, how to control it (keyborad or mouse), to determine some logics.

this is my prompt 
”write a p5.js code for 1942, where the user use the keyboard to control his F35, with the arrow keys to move up, down, left and right. The user use the Space key to fire the bullet. There are enemy air forces randomly coming from the top edge of the screen and shooting missiles to the F35. If the F35's bullet hit the enemy planes, the user will get 1 point. If the F35 is hit by the enemy missiles, then the user lose the game. I want to use my own texture of the F35 jet plane and the enemy air force planes.” My whole conversation with ChatGPT can be found here: 

2️⃣ Register an account in openprocessing.org, and create a sketch, save it. Then copy and paste your code into the editor. We want to make it customized and stunning, so use #Midjourney or other AI tool to create some pictures for your game assets and background. In the later part of my conversation with ChatGPT, I want to add some audio effect to it, so make sure you find some sound effects as well. 

3️⃣ When you are ready, run it, if you face any bugs, paste it to ChatGPT to ask for a fix. The more complicated your code, the more bugs and missing logics in ChatGPT’s code. You can spend somewhere between 15 min to a few HOURS of back and forth conversation with ChatGPT.
